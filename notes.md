You donâ€™t learn to program by reading a book. You will only truly learn if you sit down and program.

C# is a statically typed, garbage collected, objectoriented programming language with imperative, functional, and event-driven aspects.

.NET also includes a pile of code that you can use in your program directly. This collection is called the Base Class Library (BCL).

.NET includes a broad set of tools called a Software Development Kit (SDK) that makes programming life easier.

.NET is an ecosystem. Aside from C#, the three other most popular languages are Visual Basic, F#, and PowerShell.

Namespaces are purely code organization tools, but they are valuable when dealing with hundreds or thousands of classes.
